#### KPI defined in this report are:
1.	Total calls
2.	Total calls answered
3.	Total calls resolved
4.	Overall satisfaction
5.	Average Speed of answer
6.  Answered vs Unanswered calls

## Data Sourcing
The dataset was provided in an excel workbook.

## Data Description
To show an understanding of the dataset, the data description is shown below:

## Mockup draft
Based on the report requirements, a draft of the report was thoughtful created (_shown below_) as a guide in the course of building the report.

## ETL
Power BI desktop was launched and connected to Excel workshop as that is the format of the dataset. Lots of transformation process was carried out such:
-  Checked all the tables, rows and columns to ensure consistent formatting, no missing values and duplicate values. 
- Used first row as header
- Replaced null values with 0 in AvgTalk and satisfaction columns as they represent calls that were unanswered 
- Created custom column to have the call duration in seconds and removed the initial call duration column (AvgTalkDuration)
After these, I closed and applied settings to start analysis

## DAX measures calculations
The following measures were calculated to aid my analysis.

## Dashboard Design
The background of the dashboard was designed in power point with the mock up draft as a guide. It was saved as PNG file and imported in Power BI.

### Analysis and Visualization
Using the mockup draft and following the report requirements, I built the dashboard as required.

The interactive dashboard can be accessed [here]( https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNGM3M2FjMTAtMDM2ZC00MDFiLTg0MTktMjZhNGVkNGE5ZWNmIiwidCI6ImFmMWJhNzExLTA2MmMtNGYzZS04YmNjLWQyY2U4N2RjNGQwYSJ9)

### Interpretation
-	Approximately 81% of the calls are answered and 90% are resolved
-	January experienced the highest number of calls as well as resolved calls
-	11am â€“ 15:30 appears to be the peak period for calls
-	Overall satisfaction is 3.40 and three agents fell below this rating
-	Average speed of answer is 67.52 and more than half of the agents fell below the average
-	Only two agents are above the average percentage of resolved calls
-	Only one agent fell below the average percentage of answered calls

Further insights can be gotten by using the filtering the visuals by topic, agents and resolved.
